Speight, in <a href='https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/5230'>Australian soil and land survey field handbook (3rd edn)</a>.</p> <p>In this technique for describing landforms, the whole land surface is viewed as a mosaic of tiles of odd shapes and sizes. The scheme is intended to produce a record of observations rather than inferences.</p>  <p>The data was converted from the print representation to this linked-data form by <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0693-1899\">Linda Gregory</a> assisted by <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3884-3420\">Simon J D Cox</a>.</p>"^^rdf:HTML ;

To think clearly about the origin of a landform, one should ask two questions: ‘What agent formed it?’ and ‘What was the mode of activity of that agent?’\r
Landforms created by different agents, such as wind, creep, and stream flow, may result from the same mode of geomorphological activity: erosion, for example. Those created by the same agent may differ according to whether the mode of activity builds them up or erodes them down.\r

    skos:definition """For detailed work, the location of the site within the toposequence down a slope line may relate to landform processes. Unfortunately, slope lines, by definition, extend from a summit to the lowest point (Cayley 1859), which may be many kilometres apart. One must arbitrarily determine the effective top and bottom of the toposequence. These effective end points come where the slope line coalesces with other slope lines to form a ridge line or a course line* (Figure 2a). In practice, ridge lines and course lines are to be excluded from the toposequence (see earlier section on landform element height). One arbitrary rule that will exclude the ridge line is to put the top of the toposequence where the contour curvature exceeds 60º in 40 m. The course line may be excluded by the same rule, or by putting the bottom of the toposequence at a stream channel.\r
Any site can be located by its vertical and horizontal distances from the defined top and bottom of the toposequence. Drainage height (page 88) is one of these measures.\r
The toposequence concept leads to definition of the attributes specific catchment area and specific dispersal area (Speight 1974, 1980) that predict hillslope hydrology and erosion (see, for example, Moore et al. 1988)."""@en ;

    skos:definition """Modal slope is defined as the most common class of slope occurring in a landform pattern. Where slope classes have been obtained by systematic sampling, define the classes using equal increments on a scale of the logarithm of the slope tangent, a procedure intended to normalise frequency distributions of observed slope (Speight 1971). Where the most common slope class is estimated by direct observation, it is thought that the estimate will compare with that calculated using the log-normal model.\r
Modal slope class determines the use of certain adjectives applied to landform patterns that are characterised by alternating crests and depressions. These are: rolling for moderate modal slopes (10–32%); undulating for gentle slopes (3–10%); and gently undulating for very gentle slopes (1–3%) (compare with Soil Survey Staff 1951, pages 161–165). The other slope classes, precipitous, very steep, steep and level, are to be applied as they stand. The terminology for simple erosional landform patterns based on relief and modal slope is given in Table 5.\r
Table 5 defines the category badlands by various combinations of high slope values and low relief values. These combinations imply extremely close spacing of streams or valleys. Specifically, if one assumes a sawtooth terrain profile, the valley spacing implied is less than 100 m in areas with 50 m relief and less than 30 m in areas with 5 m relief; these values appear to accord with usage.\r
Table 7 lists types of landform pattern in order of their typical class of modal slope. This table should not be regarded as definitive, for slope within each type of landform pattern may vary widely."""@en ;

Its estimation will be made easier by visualising two surfaces of accordance that are planar or gently curved, one touching the major crests of a landform pattern, and the other passing through the major depressions. The average vertical separation of the two surfaces is a measure of the relief. Make this estimation at a field site, either visually or by using a map, and express it in metres.\r
Relief is the definitive characteristic for the terms mountains, hills, low hills, rises and plains when used as types of erosional landform pattern (Table 5). The class boundaries, shown in Tables 5 and 6, are set at 300 m, 90 m, 30 m and 9 m. These class limits and the class names are similar to those used by Löffler (1974), and are broadly compatible with those of Löffler and Ruxton (1969).\r
Table 6 lists types of landform pattern defined in the glossary according to their typical relief class. Those types for which the relief class is definitive are in italics."""@en ;
