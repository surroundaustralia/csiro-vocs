# CSIRO vocabs for VocPrez testing
These vocabularies are CSIRO-owned vocabularies that are being used for testing the deployment of a [VocPrez](https://github.com/RDFLib/VocPrez/). They are being reprocessed using the script `vocab_processor.py` to change their semantic scrutural elements, but not their textual content or their essential meaing, so that they can be displayed effectively by VocPrez.

The original CSIROvocab files are:

* landform_0.ttl
* soil-prof_0.ttl

The final vocab files for VocPrez loading are:

* landform_4.ttl
* soil-prof_4.ttl
