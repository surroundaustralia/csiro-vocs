(The presence of calcium carbonate is not common and the red-brown hardpan in which it occurs may be relatively brittle and finely laminar.) The red-brown hardpan is usually present below the soil profile and is not a feature of any particular soil group. (It has some similarity with other silica pans such as duripans of arid climates). In many instances, it is not known if the red-brown hardpan is a paleosol or a cemented sediment (Wright 1983). If thought to be the latter, it may be described as a substrate material. "@en ;

Primary peds are the simplest peds occurring in soil material; they cannot be divided into smaller peds, but may be packed together to form compound peds of a higher level of organisation (Brewer 1964).\r
The order of peds and relationship of one to the other is important and may be described as the larger peds parting to the smaller and further where necessary. For example, 'strong 50-100 mm columnar, parting to moderate 20-50 mm prismatic, parting to moderate\r
10-20 mm angular blocky'. The word 'parting' and not 'breaking' is used. The term 'breaking' is used when soil is fractured along planes other than natural planes of weakness.\r

Soil colours rarely match the chart colour chips perfectly. They should be matched to the chip closest in colour, or the nearest whole number in chroma where chips are not provided, for example chromas 5 and 7.\r
The soil colour is measured on the surface of a freshly broken aggregate of moist soil. Moisten the soil if it is dry. Record the colour when the visible moisture film disappears from the surface of the moistened broken aggregate. The aggregate should be held as close as possible to the colour chips. Take care not to smear the broken surface, as this can give an incorrect recording of the colour of the soil matrix.\r

For example, a very permeable, coarse-textured soil occurring in a wet depression would have to be classed as very poorly drained. Hence there is a need to consider permeability, which refers to the potential of a soil to transmit water internally, and drainage, which refers to the rapidity and extent of water removal from the soil profile or site. Both these aspects of internal drainage may be difficult to assess in the field, and cannot be based solely on profile morphology. Mottling may, but not always, reflect drainage status, since mottling may be a relict feature. Vegetation and topography may be useful guides.\r
These concepts of permeability and drainage are largely based on Canada Soil Survey Committee (1978)."""@en ;

In virtually all material that has structure, the surface of individual peds will differ in some way from the interior of peds. The degree of development expresses the relative difference between the strength of cohesion within peds and the strength of adhesion between adjacent peds. Determination of grade of structure in the field depends on the proportion of peds that hold together as entire peds when displaced and also on the ease with which the soil separates into discrete peds. Grade of pedality varies with the soil water status. It is important to record the soil water status of the described profile, and it is desirable that the grade of pedality be described at the soil water status most common for the horizon."@en ;
